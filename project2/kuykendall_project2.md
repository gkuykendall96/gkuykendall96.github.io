I wanted to look at the changes in Howard County over the last fifty years. I grew up in Howard County so I was interest in the development of parks, I believe growth in the number public parks is a sign of the growth of suburbs. Howard County is geared towards families because of their school system and general environment. The 1980s and 1990s showed the most expansion in parks. Howard County's population increased 91% in the 1980s and 58% in the 1990s, backing up my claim.
