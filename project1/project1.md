#### Project 1
I used the data set real_properties from our professor; the Charm City Routes and Stops shapefiles, the Baltimore Polygon from the Baltimore GIS database. I used the buffer tool to find an area within one mile(a reasonable walking distance) of the Charm City stops, then clipped the real_properites layer to the area of the buffer. I used the a DEM from a previous lab that covered Maryland and DC to set the elevation levels and clipped by mask. From there I created spacalite data to create a new shapefile for the the Residental zones and the taxes they pay to the state. I did the same for the whole real_properties shapefile to compare the area I selected to the rest of Baltimore City. I attempted to use the QthreeGis plugin but because of the large size of my data it crashed and froze a lot. Instead I created a 3d view of and navigated to illustrate different areas. Often times environmental issues are seen as classist, where the wealthy or priveleged have more time to worry about the environment because they are not facing other issues head on. The Charm City Electric Bus is a good initiative but I think it is important for these buses to have value outside the wealthier areas of the city like downtown near the harbor and other areas that were lower in elevation and closer to the water in order to show environmental impact awareness initiative in these communities. It was hard to portray because I think I needed to sort the data more and eliminate outliers and portray the averages more.
