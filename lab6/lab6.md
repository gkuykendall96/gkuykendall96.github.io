#### Part 3

I decided to look at homicides within Houston, Texas from 1991 to 1995 to see if there was spatial correlation within the city. The issue with my analysis is that I should have normalized the data with population data of each district rather than only the homicide data. There was one district that had 15 times more homicides than the next highest, I am assuming because of the density of that district.
##### Houston Base

This map shows Houston and the districts I looked at. 
##### Natural Breaks

This map shows the areas with the highest and lowest homicide density. 
##### LISA Cluster

This map was calculated with 9999 permuations and 0.001 p value significance. It is showing a cluster of low homicides in dark blue and a cluster of high in dark red, most of the areasa were not significant.
##### LISA Signficance

The areas of significance seem to be similarly attached to population, which makes sense because I did not normalize it but also important because those are the areas that will actually have enough incidents to track and that will have value.
