# Project Write Up
#### What are you going to do for the final project?
I am using election data and voter turnout data in Fairfax County Virginia to see what factors effect turnout in different regions in Fairfax.
#### What is your question?
Why is Fairfax County voter turnout so high, 82.5? What factors affect it the most within the county?
#### Where is the data coming from? Provide links? If you don't have - or can't find - the data, pick a different project.
https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/maps/open-geospatial-data provides information about taxes, schools, and other things to keep in mind while looking at voting turnout.
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?metadata_type=geospatial&_metadata_type_limit=0&q=Elections
This contains the voting data for Fairfax County.
#### What three non-superficial elements from the class are you going to incorporate? Python? SQL? Moran's I? 3D mapping? Hexagonal analysis? Analysis in GeoDa? Something else? (Non-superficial meaning doing more than importing the data with python.)
I think hexagonal analysis will help me compare turnout consistently between different elements. GeoDa will be important because I will be working with large datasets and will be cutting out the important things and stitching together and separating data to better portray my results. 2.5D mapping would be great to display hexagons especially because I will be comparing turnout to another element, hexagon height and color can represent two different things and make information easier to understand.
#### How will you know when you've answered your question?
When I am able to show a clear relationship between voter turnout and education or wealth.
#### What other component from the class will you incorporate?
I wanted to incorporate the backdrop and design elements that we went over in the first labs.
#### Why is more involved than the labs?
I think because Fairfax's GIS portal and data is so abundant I am able to use a lot of information to get better results but also this means a lot more of sifting through what is important and also finding ways to make the abundance of data relevant and tie in together.
Why did you choose this component?
I thought it would be really neat to be able to have visuals on voter turnout, Fairfax is close by and had data that worked. A lot of voter turnout maps I looked at were mostly national data shown in percentages. While this topic is well researched I thought it would be more interesting to take a closer look with a more in-depth map and I liked that I could have more freedom to try different things because of the different data sets available.

I've been using these sites to evaluate school demographics and graduation rates better.
